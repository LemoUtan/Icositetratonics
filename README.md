# Icositetratonics
A catalogue of 24-tone music's Pitch Class Set shapes, analogous to those of Allen Forte for dodecatonic (12 tone) music

Labelling uses a 'base 36' system of numbering where 0 to 9 stand for the usual number values and A to Z take on values from 10 to 36 (although the largest such 'digit' in this collection will never exceed 'O' for 24). This obviates the need for separating numeric quantities by commas, thus compressing the space needed for representing tuples and also allowing one to sort such tuples alphabetically in a meaningful way. The table columns are:

1. the **intervals** found between all distinct PC pairs in the set - akin to Forte's 'interval vector'
2. the **shape** of the set in terms of its internal interval (in quartertones) jumps
3. the **sym**metries of the set - both cyclic and dihedral - which can be found amongst these sets
